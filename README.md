# NaturalDisasterMapper-G575

Final Project for Geography 575 Interactive Cartography and Geovisualization.  This tool was built with the theoretical user being that of a manager or engineer looking to delegate funds to reinforce civil infrastructure in areas of high natural disasters.  This was a collaborative project, and was built using <a href="http://leafletjs.com">leaflet</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a>.
